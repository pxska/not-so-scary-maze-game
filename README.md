# not-so-scary-maze-game
### NB! Requires PyGame

I made this game in collaboration with @peeterpaal in high school. The point is to go take the fishy,
go through the checkpoints and reach the end without touching the maze. If you touch the maze, you have to
try again. This was my very first larger project in Python.
